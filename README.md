## üñ•Ô∏è Project Versions  

This project went through **three main stages** during development:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Terminal Version (CLI)  
- The very first version, fully running in the terminal.  
- Allowed the user to choose between today's matches or matches for a specific date.  
- Data was fetched and saved to `Match.csv` for further use.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Simple GUI Version  
- A lightweight graphical interface replicating the terminal version‚Äôs functionality.  
- Easier to interact with compared to the CLI.  
- Still saves match data into `Match.csv`.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced GUI Version  
- A more polished and user-friendly interface.  
- Added extra features and a better layout.  
- Provides a smoother experience while keeping CSV export functionality.  

> Each version helped me better understand **Web Scraping**, **File Handling**, and how to improve usability over time.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
